# Situation
I previously worked with an assessment service provider that conducted academic subject tests designed to help adults obtain their high school equivalency diploma. The credential earned through these tests could have a significant impact on their lives, as it provided access to better employment opportunities and higher education, as well as served as a positive example for younger students.

Our client was interested in identifying patterns of testing performance differentials across the academic subject test market that may have been linked to local testing facilities and resources. They were also interested in exploring the potential factors driving those discrepancies.

By understanding these patterns, our client aimed to proactively communicate with relevant jurisdictions about areas that may have benefited from additional support. Ultimately, the goal was to take concrete actions that could help improve the persistence rates of those who were pursuing their high school equivalency diploma through our client's testing service.

# Process Framework
The analysis process followed an adaptive approach, utilizing causal inference techniques, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and unsupervised modeling techniques.

In overview, the following steps were taken:

* Data cleaning and merging
* Causal inference was applied to identify important features and their impact on test performance.
* Data was prepared for modeling.
* Clustering was performed to identify patterns and cluster properties.
* Analysis and insights were generated based on the results obtained from the previous steps.
