I previously worked with an assessment service provider that conducted academic subject tests designed to help adults obtain their high school equivalency diploma.
The credential earned through these tests could have a significant impact on their lives, as it provided access to better employment opportunities and higher education,
as well as served as a positive example for younger students.

Our client was interested in identifying patterns of testing performance differentials across the academic subject test market that may have been linked to 
local testing facilities and resources. They were also interested in exploring the potential factors driving those discrepancies.

By understanding these patterns, our client aimed to proactively communicate with relevant jurisdictions about areas that may have benefited from additional support. 
Ultimately, the goal was to take concrete actions that could help improve the persistence rates of those who were pursuing their high school equivalency diploma 
through our client's testing service.
